Ray Intersection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project offers a header only acceleration structure library including
implementations for a BVH- and KD-Tree. Applications may include ray
intersection tests or nearest neighbor searches.

As an example application a simple raycasting app for
[MVE](https://github.com/simonfuhrmann/mve) scenes is provided.

The application was inspired by
[coldet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/coldet/).
